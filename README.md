After waiting for sometime the host invited the speaker harpreet mam our hod .she made us feel that we are a part of gndec.i felt very proud of myself that I got opportunity to get admission in gndec.
Then our respected principal sir motivated us to work hard so that we can achieve great platforms in future . He also taught us to to participate in sports or in other curricular activities. It will not only help us to have confidence in ourself but also it will build our personalities also.
